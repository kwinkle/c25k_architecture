List of Sessions with issues (to remember for Data Analysis)

Week 1:
LB Session 1 [CONTROL] control engagement actions failed 
JW Session 1 [SUPERVISED] tablet supervisor failed resulting in programme & engagement actions failing (Don ran session manually); missing some state logger data


Week 2:
MB Session 3 [SUPERVISED] programme actions failed mid-session (Don finished session manually)
JF Session 5 [SUPERVISED] no action moderator (Don ran session manually)
GB Session 5 [CONTROL] missing from state logger (see if can find in older committed versions...?)
JW Session 3 [SUPERVISED] missing from state logger

Week 3:
MR Session 3 [SUPERVISED] didn't close down at session end

Week 4:
LB Session 9 [SUPERVISED] didn't close down at session end 

Week 5:
Lost data for PT-5 and DB-8 (need to manually update user records with session number/programme time)
PT-5 and PT-6 session confusion - on 5 control robot was accidentally labelled as supervised and in 6 control script was started too late and no engagement actions were given at all
GB Session 10 [SUPERVISED] heart rate monitor failed 

Note: Best trained learner with suggest to tablet bugs fixed up and running from JW Session 12 (timestamp >= ...1563375952.25)
Programme suggested styles were not displayed correctly on tablet (but recorded correctly in data logs - hence only affecting Don's experience of the learner performance) until JF Session 11
