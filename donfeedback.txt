[LB 23] Great starting selection of actions, choice in timings and variation. Could be more serious about challenging themselves, especially when entering the end of a program. Some sentences said after each other randomly can have contradictory meanings thus probably confusing for the client. Well timed use of humour. Good evolution of speech over the course of the run, becoming more challenging towards the end. What I've wanted to see Pepper, very happy. 

[LB 24] Actions: grat choice (+ specific dialogue), timing and variation. Good starting combination of sympathetic challenge and maintenance (for technique), early instructions to 'zone out'. Amazing near-end-of-run speech. Much much better cooldown speech. Very happy (another) great session.

[DP 25] First action very fast. Good suggestions and timing. CLient specific profile is impressive. Sympathetic time a little early but subjective... great dialogue.

[DP 26] Great selection of starting actions. DP + Pepper: love the communication, call and response relationship.  

[FB 22] Good variation and timing. Sympathetic time too early? Poor choice of cool down speech. 

[FB 23] Different start (humour focused) unique but still with good action choice and variation. Personalisation. Good smart use of speech/actions. Slightly repetetive 'maintenance' - justified? yes to be fair. Not constant, evolved throughout the run, desired learner behaviour. 2x check pre used one after the other (I'm being pedantic now). Quiet cool down = desirable. Great session. 

[JF 23] First action too fast. A lot of sympathy and a lot of praise. Check pre with 100s left...hmm... expected better finish.

[JF 24] Start on-point. Great choice and timing of actions. Slightly praise heavy...justified? Check pre better, not challenging.

[JW 23] Very good selection of dialogue. Very happy. Choice, variation, timing = on-point. Too much check pre (x2).

[JF 24] Random variation in actions? Sympathetic time far too soon. Better action choice at run end. 

[GB 24] Good timing and variation in actions but bad first choice of sympathetic time. Remains praise heavy, loses its sincerity? Learner keeping good variation. Amazing performance by Pepper. Good dialogue/speec choice at the end and a post run check pre. Very happy.

[GB 25] Bad first choice 'not long now' with 30 minutes to go. Praise heavy but relevant. Still keeping good action variation. A lot of chat during the cooldown. 

[MR 19] Very fast first action, some variation but praise heavy although that's definitely justified. Good positive variation, i.e. not just ising or consistely using the same action especially positive time. Good timing of check pre (and in cool down). Good action choice, timing and variation. Impressive. Interesting use and timing of 'dance' [animation] action near the end of the run, don't think I've ever done that?

[MR 20] Again good timing and selection of actions. Deserves praise - not too much use challenging someone already giving their everything. Therefore less need for Pepper.

[DB 19] Happy. Praise heavy, lacking situational awareness? Sometimes with poor timing of speech revealing the robotic nature of Pepper. Not quite relevant/logical/sincere. Good versus great trainer. A lot of positive time - not enough dialogue. Better end of run speech/actions. Better cooldown dialogue/actions. Not perfect. 

[DB 20] Generally good action selection. Can't tell whether actions/speech is chosen at repeated intervals of time... it must be good if I can't tell? Too slow to realise the needs of the situation and react accordingly i.e. slows fown for a breather/break and Pepper rewards praise/positive. Not sure there's anything Pepper could say to estabish connection at this stage. Better cooldown behaviour, evolved speech/action choice i.e. becoming more challenging towards the end.

[PT 19] So good at the start! Love the choice and variation... unitl it constantly repeats praise. Ok far too much praise. Just too much repetition. Poor finish...

[PT 20] Very good start! On-poiint timing and choice. So impressed. Finish could be more engaging.
